             SELF DRIVING CAR is the second part of the Autonomous Car Project. Built purely with HTML,CSS, and JavaScript. No Libraries

The project began with arrow-key-controlled car movement on a straight road. A ray function detected road borders, and collision detection was implemented. Traffic elements were added with extended collision detection. A machine learning algorithm featured levels, neurons, and output for autonomous car control. It used weights, biases, and a feedforward algorithm. A mutate function accelerated evolution for multiple cars. The fitness function evaluated performance based on the lowest y-value(y decreases upwards). The simulation allowed saving the "best car" instead of starting anew, enhancing efficiency. This project combines game development, simulation, and machine learning for autonomous car navigation. If you have specific questions, feel free to ask!
